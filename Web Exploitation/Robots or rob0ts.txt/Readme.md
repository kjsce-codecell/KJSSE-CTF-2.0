## Solution

`robots.txt` doesn't open anything but on `rob0ts.txt` we see this.

So we bruteforce the directories from 1 to 100 considering the numbers go at `rob(N)ts.txt`.

```python
with open("bf.txt", "w") as file:
    for n in range(101):
        filename = f"rob{n}ts.txt"
        file.write(filename + "\n")  

print("Done!")
```

`rob72ts.txt` has a lot of lines so let's check that out.

It looks like an empty file but when we select all of the contents, there is whitespace in the file.<br>

It can be decoded using the [Whitespace decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/whitespace-language)
